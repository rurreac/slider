# A Note on a Next Console:

Ideally Server and Clients should have different Consoles.

- We should be able to connect to each Slider Client Console from the server. 
- Once on the Client Console could jump to a Shell or execute commands without directly streaming them over the 
SSH channel.
- It should make a smoother transition from Shell to Console
- Server Console could extend functionality with Go plugins
- Client Console could have a fixed functionality per OS
